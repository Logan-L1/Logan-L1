# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

I am Logan Lilley and I am a tech enthusiast.

### Why I Made This

I am currently studying cybersecurity and looking to start my career in that industry. In the meantime I am entertaining myself with random technical projects such as this and my online resume which can be found with this link [Online Resume](https://logan-l1.github.io/online_resume/). Also working on cybersecurity projects to demostrate my skills.

### Other Technical Hobbies

Other then cybersecurity I am very interested in trading stocks and forex and have created bots to trade automaticlly. I have worked with python to create a bot that worked with Broker Alpaca's API. I have also created forex trading bots using MetaTrader 4 and 5 using its coding languages MQL4 and MQL5.

### Get In Touch With Me

If any of these interest you reach out to me. Where I am from there are not many people with similar interests. So I would be happy to work with someone on any projects.
